# Freemocap566
the data from comapring the freemocap (fmc) to the expensive mocap (emc) is found in the "comparison" folder.

The EMCsorting.py file converts the output emc files to something more usable for us. ive already converted all the data. the converted data is called "filteredEMCData" these file are also copied to the shared folder on the cloud.

the "FMCanimation" file will animate all of our freemocap data. i will modify it a bit more for the rest of our files. currently it only works for 1 file.

the "EMCanimation" file works for the emc data that has been filtered. the graph takes time to run and doesnt move very quickly so be patient with it. i think the scaling needs some work or something like that. 


the "graphTest" file is not important

next up i will generalize the fmc animation and run more tests on the emc animation
